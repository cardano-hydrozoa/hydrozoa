/** The **byte-level storage primitive** behind the persistence layer — a sorted key-value store
  * divided into [[Cf column families]], with atomic batched writes and range-scan iterators.
  *
  * This is *not* the actor-facing API. Actors use the typed [[Persistence]] trait, which sits on
  * top of a `BackendStore` and threads keys / values through the [[StoreKey]] codecs. Direct
  * `BackendStore` access is reserved for:
  *
  *   - the storage engine implementation (`rocksdb.RocksDbBackendStore`);
  *   - debugging / inspection tools that legitimately work at the byte level (e.g. [[StoreDump]]);
  *   - specialised modules that derive state from raw key scans (e.g. `Markers`, which uses
  *     `lastKey` / `lastKeyWithPrefix` to derive the four markers from their CFs).
  *
  * Values are opaque bytes at this layer; the typed view lives one layer up.
  *
  * See `design/persistence-and-crash-recovery.md` §7.
