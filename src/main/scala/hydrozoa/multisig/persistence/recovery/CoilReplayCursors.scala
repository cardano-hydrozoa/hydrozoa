/** A coil peer's recovery scan / feed cursors — the coil counterpart of [[ReplayCursors]] (§5.3,
  * §10 Q10). The head primitives are rigidly `HeadPeerNumber`-typed and anchor the fast/slow sides
  * on `softAcked` / `hardAcked`; a coil peer differs in three ways, so it gets a parallel type
  * rather than a `PeerId`-widened one:
  *
  *   - **fast-side ledger floor** is `coilBlockMark + 1`, not `softAcked + 1` (a coil peer authors
  *     no soft-ack; its fast anchor is `max(BlockResult)`, §6 `JointLedger`);
  *   - **slow-side composer floor** is `coilHardAckedStack + 1`, sourced from the last own
  *     `CoilHardAck` value (not `HardAck`, §6 `StackComposer`);
  *   - it additionally replays the **`HubHardAck`** families (one per hub) — the coil quorum its
  *     `SlowConsensusActor` aggregates (§3.1, the `+ H` of `2 + 3N + H`) — and its **own**
  *     `CoilHardAck` family.
  *
  * The shared spines + head satellites carry the same dual-floor / single-floor structure as
  * [[ReplayCursors]] (the aggregator floors `softConfirmed + 1` / `hardConfirmed + 1` are shared —
  * a coil peer's `FastConsensusActor` aggregates head soft-acks and its `SlowConsensusActor`
  * aggregates head hard-acks just like a head peer's).
