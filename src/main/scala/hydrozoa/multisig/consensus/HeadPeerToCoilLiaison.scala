/** A hub head's liaison toward one coil it serves (§8 of `design/coil-network.md`).
  *
  * Asymmetric, the mirror image of [[CoilPeerToHeadLiaison]]: its outbox carries everything the hub
  * holds — briefs, soft-acks, head hard-acks, and the relayed `HubCoilAckLane` (fed by the hub's
  * actors) — while its inbound direction receives only that coil's own hard-acks. Each one is
  * routed BOTH to the hub's local [[SlowConsensusActor]] (so the hub counts it toward quorum) and
  * to the [[CoilAckSequencer]] (which stamps it and relays it onto the `HubCoilAckLane`).
  *
  * Pc3 scope is one head / one coil, where the hub is the sole head author so the outbox is sourced
  * from the hub's own production (sparse briefs == full at one leader). The multi-head relay — full
  * briefs from all leaders and multiplexed soft/hard-acks sourced from the hub's received-from-mesh
  * state (§8 "cost of being a hub") — is deferred to Pc4.
