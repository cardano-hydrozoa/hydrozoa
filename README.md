## Build the specification

Build this project's PDF specification from the LaTeX files in the `specification` subdirectory.

Please ensure that [nix is installed](https://nixos.org/download/#download-nix) in your system and [flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

Build in one step:
    ```bash
    make spec
    ```

Clean all files generated by `make spec`:
    ```bash
    make spec-clean
    ```
