# Hydrozoa

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Java JDK 11+, [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) or [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

If you use Nix, you can run `nix develop` to get a shell with all the dependencies.

### Setup IntelliJ IDEA

File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources -> select the project directory -> Import project from external model ->
BSP -> Sbt

### Building with sbt

Run `sbt` to enter the sbt shell.

Run `compile` to compile the project.

Run `run` to run the node.

Run `test` to run the tests.

### Private network

Currently, Hydrozoa works against a private network provided by 
[Yaci DevKit](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-devkit).
Here is the [link](https://devkit.yaci.xyz/docker) to installation page.

Create and run the network:

```shell
devkit
> create-node
> start
```

#### Resetting the local Cardano node

If you need to reset the local testnet (in the devkit shell):

```shell
reset
```

## Build the specification

Build this project's PDF specification from the LaTeX files in the `specification` subdirectory.

Please ensure that [nix is installed](https://nixos.org/download/#download-nix) in your system and [flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

Build in one step:
    ```bash
    make spec
    ```

Clean all files generated by `make spec`:
    ```bash
    make spec-clean
    ```
